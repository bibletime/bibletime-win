Manual Build

This project uses a cmake script to create a build system for Microsoft Visual Studio.
It will build BibleTime and create an install package. 


Installed Requirements:

Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition (2022)
cmake (recent version like 3.17+)
NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
git
Qt 6.8.2

******************************************
Build steps

1. Create a directory for building BibleTime.

2. Change into this directory.

3. Clone the bibletime/bibletime-win git repository.

4. In the parent directory of bibletime-win create a "build" directory.

5. Run this bat script to initialize Visual Stutio.
     "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\vc\Auxiliary/Build\vcvars64.bat"

6. From the "build" directory run init64.bat like this:
  ..\bibletime-win\init64.bat   (edit init64.bat if necessary to change compilers or paths) 

7. Run either of the following commands to build the windows installer.

    devenv.exe (open bibletime-win.sln and use the menu ALL_BUILD/build in the Solution Explorer)

    msbuild /target:bibletime /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win64 bibletime-win.sln

8, If the build works correctly you should see a line that looks simular to this:
   CPack: - package: C:/bibletime/build/bibletime-prefix/src/bibletime-build/BibleTime-master-win64.exe generated.
This exe file is the installer package for BibleTime.
