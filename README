Build BibleTime for Windows

This project uses a cmake script to create a build system for Microsoft Visual Studio.
It will build BibleTime and create an install package. 


Installed Requirements:

Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition (2019)
cmake (recent version like 3.17)
NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
git
Qt 5.15.2


The environment variable VCINSTALLDIR must be correctly set or the Microsoft 
redistributible library won't be copied to the package. One way to do this 
is to run the vcvars32.bat script in a cmd windows and then launch devenv.exe
For VS 2019 installed at the default location:

"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\vc\Auxiliary/Build\vcvars32.bat"
devenv.exe

Clone this git repository creating the bibletime-win directory
In the parent directory of bibletime-win create a "build" directory.
From the "build" directory run init.bat like this:
  ..\bibletime-win\init.bat   (edit init.bat if necessary to change compilers or paths) 
Open the bibletime-win.sln solution in Visual Studio. It will be in the "build" directory.
Build the solution. 

If the build works correctly you should see a line that looks like this:

7>  CPack: - package: C:/bibletime/build/bibletime-prefix/src/bibletime-build/BibleTime-3.0.0_rc1-win32.exe generated.

This exe file is the installer package for BibleTime.
