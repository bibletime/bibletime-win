Manual Build

This project uses a cmake script to create a build system for Microsoft Visual Studio.
It will build BibleTime and create an install package. 


Installed Requirements:

Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition (2019)
cmake (recent version like 3.17+)
NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
git
Qt 5.15.2

Clone this git repository creating the bibletime-win directory
In the parent directory of bibletime-win create a "build" directory.

Run this bat script
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\vc\Auxiliary/Build\vcvars32.bat"

From the "build" directory run init32.bat like this:
  ..\bibletime-win\init32.bat   (edit init32.bat if necessary to change compilers or paths) 

Run either of the following commands to build the windows installer.

1.
devenv.exe (open bibletime-win.sln and build all)

2.
msbuild /target:bibletime /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win32 bibletime-win.sln


If the build works correctly you should see a line that looks like this:
   CPack: - package: C:/bibletime/build/bibletime-prefix/src/bibletime-build/BibleTime-3.0.2-win32.exe generated.
This exe file is the installer package for BibleTime.
